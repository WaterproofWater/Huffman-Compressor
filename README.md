# Huffman Encoder/Decoder
## 	<sub> Purpose: </sub> 
  The goal of this project is to compress my previous class materials as they are eating up a good chunk of my storage drive and to be still able to decompress losslessly later on whenever I like.

## 	<sub> Usage:	</sub>
  1. Download the source files.
  2. Work is still in progress.

<sub> Feel free to use this encoder/decoder for your irrelevant coursework too if they are starting to take up a good portion of your storage.</sub>
