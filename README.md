# Huffman Encoder/Decoder
## 	<sub> Purpose: </sub> 
  The goal of this project is to compress my previous class materials as they are eating up a good chunk of my storage drive and to be still able to decompress losslessly later on.

## 	<sub> Usage:	</sub>
  1. Download the source files in a folder.
  2. Save the files you wish to compress to the same folder.
  3. Open the project using your preferred IDE.
  4. Run Compressor.java if you want to compress (enter in a file one at a time).
  5. Run Decompressor.java to decompress (same guide as the Compressor).

<sub> Feel free to use this encoder/decoder for your previous coursework too if they are starting to take up a good portion of your storage.</sub>
